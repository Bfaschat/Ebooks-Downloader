# Ebook Downloader Script

Script for downloading books from www.allitebooks.com

To use the software you just have to:   
1) Change the paths according to your own needs
2) If given proxy does not work, you have to select another proxy (or maybe none at all!) as it may have been shut-down
3) Run 'base_script.py'
4) Enjoy!
